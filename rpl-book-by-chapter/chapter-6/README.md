# Chapter 6

Congratulations on making it to Chapter 6 of The Rust Programming Language! In this chapter, you learned about enums and pattern matching. To help solidify your understanding of these concepts, here are some fun and interesting programming challenges to tackle:

    Rock, Paper, Scissors Game:
    Create a program that allows a user to play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer. Use enums to represent the possible moves and pattern matching to determine the winner of each round.

    Digital Clock:
    Write a program that prints the time in a digital clock format. Use enums to represent the digits and pattern matching to print the correct digit for each position.

    Elevator Simulation:
    Create a program that simulates an elevator system. Use enums to represent the possible states of the elevator (e.g. moving up, moving down, stopped), and pattern matching to determine how the elevator should behave based on user input.

    Food Ordering System:
    Build a program that allows a user to order food from a menu. Use enums to represent the different menu items and pattern matching to calculate the total cost of the order.

    Battleship Game:
    Implement a two-player version of the classic game Battleship. Use enums to represent the state of each cell on the board (e.g. empty, ship, hit, miss), and pattern matching to determine the outcome of each move.

These challenges should give you plenty of hands-on practice with enums and pattern matching in Rust. Good luck, and happy coding!
