# Chapter 5

Chapter 5 of The Rust Programming Language focuses on using structs to structure related data. To help you practice the concepts discussed in this chapter, here are a few programming exercises:

- Create a struct named Person that has fields for name, age, and email. Write a function that creates a new Person and returns it. Write another function that takes a Person as input and prints out their name, age, and email.

- Create a struct named Rectangle that has fields for width and height. Write a function that calculates the area of a rectangle given its width and height. Write another function that takes a Rectangle as input and prints out its area.

- Create a struct named Point that has fields for x and y. Write a function that calculates the distance between two points. Write another function that takes two Point structs as input and prints out the distance between them.

- Create a struct named Book that has fields for title, author, isbn, and year_published. Write a function that creates a new Book and returns it. Write another function that takes a Book as input and prints out its title, author, ISBN, and year of publication.

- Create a struct named Circle that has a field for radius. Write a function that calculates the area of a circle given its radius. Write another function that takes a Circle as input and prints out its area.

These exercises should help you practice the concepts of using structs to structure related data in Rust. Good luck!
